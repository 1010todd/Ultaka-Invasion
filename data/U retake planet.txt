All settlements were wiped of inhabitants either by the Ultaka ground force or carved out entirely by orbital bombardment which from how common these craters are, it's likely was a small settlement or hideout. Aside from countless scars and smaller craters larger towns seems to be left mostly intact, except the main spaceport which were entirely destroyed.`
